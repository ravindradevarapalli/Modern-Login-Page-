# Modern Login Page Project

This project demonstrates a modern login page interface.

## Features

### Theme Customization

This application includes a flexible theme customization feature, allowing users to choose their preferred visual mode for the interface.

-   **Multiple Theme Options**:
    -   **Light Theme**: A bright, classic interface.
    -   **Dark Theme**: A darker, eye-friendly interface, ideal for low-light environments.
    -   **System Default**: Automatically syncs with your operating system's current theme preference (light or dark).

-   **Theme Toggle**:
    -   Users can easily switch between themes using the dedicated theme toggle buttons, typically located in a conspicuous area of the page (e.g., top-right corner).
    -   The available options are "Light", "Dark", and "System".

-   **Preference Persistence**:
    -   The selected theme preference (Light, Dark, or System) is automatically saved in the browser's `localStorage`.
    -   This means your chosen theme will be remembered and applied the next time you visit the page from the same browser.
